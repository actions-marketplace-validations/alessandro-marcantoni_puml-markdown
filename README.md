# __Plantuml Markdown__

This action renders and embeds _PlantUML_ diagrams inside _Markdown_ files.

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a lightweight markup language widely used in blogging, documentations and also this `README.md`. [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) is a powerful open-source tool that allows users to create diagrams from a plain text language. Thus, it is very common to have the need to insert diagrams made with _PlantUML_ inside documentation written in _Markdown_. 
Typically, there are two ways to do that:

1. Link the image generated by the _PlantUML_ diagram inside the _Markdown_ file;
2. Insert the code of the _PlantUML_ diagram inside the _Markdown_ file.

However, with both of these methods, if you make a change inside `.puml` files, the _Markdown_ files are not automatically updated. Thus, the aim is to be able to link directly the _PlantUML_ files inside _Markdown_.

## Usage

### Embed a Diagram

Adding an embedded diagram to your markdown file is very easy. Just add a link to the `.puml` file in a markdown comment like this:

```md
<!-- ![Diagram Image Link](./path/to/your/diagram.puml) -->
```

### Link Only

If you only want to insert the link to a diagram, just exclude the `!` before the link:

```md
<!-- [Diagram Image Link](./path/to/your/diagram.puml) -->
```

> For further information, please read the documentation available in the original repository of the _npm_ library exploited: [danielyaa5/puml-for-markdown](https://github.com/danielyaa5/puml-for-markdown).

### Action Usage
